# ScifiShooter

This is a 3D shooter game created in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games course.
The game features a level with enemies looking for the player to kill.

Here are some specific things I developed from scratch while making this game:
- player movement
- animation: locomotion-based blending.
- shooting system with line tracing, vfx, sfx.
- health, damage system
- enemy AI using UE5 Nav mesh for movement, Behavior Tree with Blackboard, and custom Services and Tasks.
- HUD with a simple health bar, crosshair and win/lose messages.
